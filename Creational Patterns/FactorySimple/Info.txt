Definition:
	The Simple Factory pattern creates an object without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

Concept:
	In OOP, a Factory is such an object that can create other objects. 

	• The Simple Factory pattern is not treated as a standard design pattern, but the approach is common to any application you write wher
	you want to separate the code that varies a lot from the part of code that does not vary. It is assumed that you follow this approach 
	in all the applications you write.

	• The Simple Factory pattern is considered the simplest form of the Factory Method pattern (and Abstract Factory pattern). So, you can 
	assume that any application that follows either the Factory Method pattern or the Abstract Factory pattern also follows the concept of the 
	Simple Factory pattern’s design goals.
